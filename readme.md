A stylesheet I made that i definatly didnt steal the idea for

# import
```css
@import url("https://crimtane.roxcelic.love/styles.css");
@import url("https://crimtane.roxcelic.love/light.css");
```
# dynamic js import
```html
<script src="https://crimtane.roxcelic.love/import.js"></script>
```
# credits
* crimtane bundles a copy of [reset.css by eric meyer](//meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

# update V2
not much has changed but there is now a lightmode and its way more organised.
